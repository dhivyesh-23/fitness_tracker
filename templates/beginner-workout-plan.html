        <h1>BEGINNER WEEKLY WORKOUT PLAN</h1>
        <p>A gentle introduction to fitness for those new to exercise</p>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>Welcome to your beginner workout plan! This program is designed for those who are new to regular exercise. You'll work out 3 days per week with plenty of rest in between. Focus on learning proper form, consistency, and gradually building strength and endurance.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always begin with a 5-minute warm-up (light walking, marching in place, or gentle stretching)</li>
                <li>Start with lighter weights than you think you need</li>
                <li>Rest 60-90 seconds between sets</li>
                <li>If you feel pain (not to be confused with muscle fatigue), stop the exercise</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated throughout your workout</li>
                <li>End each session with 5-10 minutes of gentle stretching</li>
