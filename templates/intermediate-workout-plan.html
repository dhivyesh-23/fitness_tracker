        <h1>INTERMEDIATE WEEKLY WORKOUT PLAN</h1>
        <p>A progressive program for those with basic fitness experience</p>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>Welcome to your intermediate workout plan! This program is designed for those who have been exercising consistently for at least 2-3 months and are comfortable with basic movement patterns. This plan introduces more challenging exercises, higher volume, and incorporates supersets to increase intensity.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always begin with a 5-8 minute dynamic warm-up</li>
                <li>Rest 45-60 seconds between sets (unless specified in supersets)</li>
                <li>Choose weights that make the last 2 reps challenging but doable with good form</li>
                <li>Track your weights to ensure progressive overload</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated throughout your workout</li>
                <li>End each session with 5-10 minutes of stretching</li>
